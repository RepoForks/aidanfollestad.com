    h4 Polar Request Manager

    p.flow-text.
        Polar Request Manager is a web-based and subscription based icon request management system that I designed for Polar Dashboard users.
        Rather than receiving emails, designers receive organized icon requests from an online dashboard which shows how many times
        an app's icon has been requested, along with whether or not you've completed the request. It can even generate appfilters
        for you. You can register an account on <a href="https://polar.aidanfollestad.com/apps">polar.aidanfollestad.com</a>. There's also
        a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afollestad.polarbackendadmin">mobile client for Android devices</a>.

    h4 Boid for Twitter

    p.flow-text.
        This is the first major project I had worked on. I had originally been working on
        another Twitter app called <em>Peeper</em> as an experiment, but <a target="_blank"
                                                                        href="https://twitter.com/redbullcat">Philip
        Oakley</a>
        and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/gmph">Graham MacPhee</a> contacted me over
        email with design mockups and ideas for a new Twitter application for Android.
        I became their coder and we worked on Boid for quite some time while it spread
        like a virus and got almost 50,000 downloads. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/kennydude">Joe
        Simpson</a>
        joined our team as another coder to help me out. We eventually had to take the
        project down from Google Play because Twitter changed their API policies
        and Boid became too much to maintain and update. You can find information
        about this project by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Boid+for+Android">searching
        Google</a>.

    p.flow-text.
        Overhear was an experimental music player I had developed to mess around with Android's content provider system.

    h4 Material Dialogs

    p.flow-text.

        available on GitHub</a>, and there's also a <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afollestad.materialdialogssample'>sample on Google Play</a>.

    h4 Material Camera
    
    p.flow-text.

        <a href='https://github.com/afollestad/material-camera'>available on GitHub</a>, along with a tutorial and Gradle
        dependency.

        Android is limited in placement and dynamic customization (for Cabinet's theme engine). This library allows the
        CAB to be dynamically themed and placed wherever you like. It can be <a href='https://github.com/afollestad/material-cab'>found on GitHub</a>.
