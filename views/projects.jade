    h4 Boid for Twitter

    p(class='flow-text').
        This is the first major project I had worked on. I had originally been working on
        another Twitter app called <em>Peeper</em> as an experiment, but <a target="_blank"
                                                                        href="https://twitter.com/redbullcat">Philip
        Oakley</a>
        and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/gmph">Graham MacPhee</a> contacted me over
        email with design mockups and ideas for a new Twitter application for Android.
        I became their coder and we worked on Boid for quite some time while it spread
        like a virus and got almost 50,000 downloads. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/kennydude">Joe
        Simpson</a>
        joined our team as another coder to help me out. We eventually had to take the
        project down from Google Play because Twitter changed their API policies
        and Boid became too much to maintain and update. You can find information
        about this project by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Boid+for+Android">searching
        Google</a>.

    h4 Overhear Music Player

    p(class='flow-text').
        Overhear was an experimental music player I had developed to mess around with Android's content provider system.

    h4 Material Dialogs

    p(class='flow-text').
        This library is a solution I had to using Material design themed dialogs across all versions of Android,
        not just Lollipop. It also makes building and theming dialogs easier. The project is <a href='https://github.com/afollestad/material-dialogs'>
        available on GitHub</a>, and there's also a <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afollestad.materialdialogssample'>sample on Google Play</a>.

    h4 Material CAB

    p(class='flow-text').
        This library is a solution to an issue I had in Cabinet. The stock contextual action bar (selection mode) on
        Android is limited in placement and dynamic customization (for Cabinet's theme engine). This library allows the
        CAB to be dynamically themed and placed wherever you like. It can be <a href='https://github.com/afollestad/material-cab'>found on GitHub</a>.

        The project is <a href='https://github.com/afollestad/digitus'>
        available on GitHub</a>, and there's also a <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afollestad.digitussample'>sample on Google Play</a>.

    h4 DragSelectRecyclerView

    p(class='flow-text').
        Google Photos made multi-selection by dragging your finger popular. I needed a solution to do this in Photo Affix,
        so this was the result. The project is <a href='https://github.com/afollestad/drag-select-recyclerview'>
        available on GitHub</a>, and there's also a <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afollestad.dragselectrecyclerviewsample'>sample on Google Play</a>.
